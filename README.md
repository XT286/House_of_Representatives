House_of_Representatives

This is the semifinalist challenge of DATA INCUBATOR. By request, I need to concatenate and clean the data from the public source: 
https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures. 

I have assemble the csv files and make them a single csv file.

I then analyze the data in order to answer the data incubator semi-final challenge questions. All the questions and answers can be found in the Python notbook.
